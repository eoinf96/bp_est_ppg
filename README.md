# bp_est_ppg_ecg
Example code for BP regression using features of the ECG and PPG

Feature extraction -- this contains matlab code to extract arterial stiffness related features from the PPG waveform\

BP est -- this contains Python code used to perform regression over these features for BP estimation

Please note that this repo contains sample code from a much larger project used to serve as an example of my coding style.
